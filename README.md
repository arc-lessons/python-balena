This repository contains episodes comprising 'Python on Balena', derived from material originally prepared by Roshan Mathew (rtm25@bath.ac.uk) suggesting good practise for running e.g. Anaconda and Juppyter notebooks on the University of Bath HPC service, Balena.  Built for [notebooks.azure.com](https://notebooks.azure.com).
The lesson is prepared using nbfancy, tthe jupyter notebooks based build system developed by Jack Betteridge and James Grant for Advancing Research Computing at University of Bath.
